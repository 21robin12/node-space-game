# Server

No setup required; just pull the repo and you're ready. Yes, I committed all my node modules, and what?

To run the application, do `node app.js` and visit http://localhost:1337

 - app.js handles the web server stuff
 - GameServer.js handles the server-side version of the game-state
 - all other relevant JS is in public/scripts
 - main.js is the client-side entry point
 - GameClient.js handles the client-side version(s) of the game-state
