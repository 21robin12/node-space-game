***TO DO***

Test in live environment

Spaceship health + healthbar
Collision
Fix multiple connection issue (old browser window can steal/block connection) -> do this via lobby & signup
Add game framework: lobby with basic "sign up", limit number of players, "rounds" of a certain time, chat
Add game objectives (deathmatch?)
Thrusters animation?


***GUIDES AND RESOURCES***
JS classes: http://robertnyman.com/2008/10/14/javascript-how-to-get-private-privileged-public-and-static-members-properties-and-methods/
Use underscore prefixing for "private" methods. See here for justification: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4484424/underscore-prefix-for-property-and-method-names-in-javascript
Document everything, this should also help to highlight more possible refactorings
